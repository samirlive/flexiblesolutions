## Onboarding

To be able to use the PayPal integration as a Store Owner, you need to onboard with your PayPal business account.

#### BEWARE!

Remember, that by default plugin is using a sandbox mode - so you need to onboard with a sandbox account.
Check out [this chapter](sandbox-vs-live.md) for more information.

1. Click **Enable PayPal** on `/admin/payment-methods` or create a new payment method with _PayPal_ gateway:

    If you will encounter following error:

    Please ensure, that your website is accessible from the internet as described in [beware section of installation docs](installation.md#beware)
    and that you are using https connection.

1. Click the _Sign up for PayPal_ button (we will try to improve the UX here [soon](https://github.com/Sylius/PayPalPlugin/issues/114)):

If everything is ok (consents are accepted, email is verified and webhooks were created successfully), you are able
to use a PayPal Commerce Platform integration ðŸŽ‰
